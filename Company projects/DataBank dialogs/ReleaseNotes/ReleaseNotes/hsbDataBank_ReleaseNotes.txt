LS:
||~23-Jan-2015 THE NEW 'Licenses Creator Dialog' IS IN TEST PERIOD (ONLY TEST USERS SHOULD USE THIS DIALOG FOR NOW)

- This dialog allows to create one or more licenses to a specific customer and one activation code per license in one step. 

The activation codes are created only if the License data includes Automatic Activation. By default the Automatic Activation is enabled.

- The process to create multiple licenses and activation codes creates an automatic email with the user, password, license ids, and activation codes to send by mail to the customer.

- Two new document files have been created to prepare the email to send the information about new licenses and activation codes. Both files are part of the Lang folder located inside of the hsbDataBank Installation Path.

- The new document files are 'NewLicenseActivationsInfo_Subject.txt' for the Subject and 'NewLicenseActivationsInfo_Body' for the Body.

- The hsbDataBank users must create their own versions of the files mentioned before for their language and purposes. Those new files must be set in the specific language folder inside of the hsbdataBank. It works in the same way that we do with other document files.

LS:
||~13-Jan-2015 THE NEW 'Licenses Administrator Dialog' IS IN TEST PERIOD (ONLY TEST USERS SHOULD USE THIS DIALOG FOR NOW)

- This dialog allows to check licenses by customer. A customer name must be introduced and the Enter key must be pressed to query the licenses associated to that customer.

- The dialog allows to filter a specific customer license to do specific changes to that license.

- The user can edit data and modules of different licenses.

- The changes done to the licenses and modules can be saved to the data base or can be required to be saved if the user forgets to save.

- The packages listed are based on the packages available to the customer's hsb office. (For example, if the customer belongs to the Belgium office, only the packages associated to that office are available to be selected.)

- The packages selected are based on the modules selected.

- The selection of a package selects the attached modules automatically if they are not already selected.

- The dependences of modules are included. If you select a module that has parent modules, the parent modules are selected.

- If you unselect a module that has child modules, the child modules are checked to see if they can be unselected. The child modules are unselected if they are not associated to other selected packages.

- Multiple changes to the data base are saved in one data base transaction. If one change to the data base fails, the complete changes are reversed. It avoids inconsitencies with the data base.

LS:
||~31-Jul-2013 BUG FIX TO LICENSES REPORT

- When there is no a 'Contract Limit Date' associated to a license, you can not save changes for that license because the read of 'Contract Limit Date' was causing an error.

- It is solved with the bug fix.

LS:
||~31-Jul-2013 BUG FIX TO LICENSES REPORT

- When you query licenses and select a license in the Licenses Report Dialog, it loads the fingerprints associated to the license automatically.

The Subject files must be txt files and the Body files must be rtf files.

The name of additional template files must start with the default file name.

For example, a defult template file name is 'NewestLicenseActivationInfo_Subject.txt' and an additional template file name could be 'NewestLicenseActivationInfo_Subject For Revit.txt'

- When you try to send an activation code by email for a customer, the Licenses dialog show a small dialog to select a template file if you have sevral template files.

- The way to add custom template files continue being the same as before. You must include the template files in the 'Lang' folder of hsbDataBank. If you have a specific file for a language, you must include it in the specific folder for the language below the 'Lang' folder.

If the LRT is TIME_LIMITED, the field of the "Number of Days or Runs" is attached to the field of the "Number of Weeks". It means that if you change the "Number of Days or Runs", the "Number of Weeks" is changed to mantain a relation between them.

In the same way, if the "Number of Weeks" is changed, the "License Maintennace Expiration Date" is changed automatically too. The changes are only in One Way because of allowing to modify the "License Maintenance Expiration Date" independently if you need.

If the LRT is different, the fileds work independently.

This new dialog is intended to manage "RDS Licenses" with "RENTAL MODE" as its priority, but you can use it in other ways.

These options can be adjusted in the future. It depends on you requirements. 

As an additional option, you will be able to modfy other properties of the Expired Licenses.

"This dialog is launched automatically each 7 days with a query of Expired Licenses of your Office." Nevertheless, you can launch it from the "Administration" menu through the "License Authorization Manager" option.

LS:
||~10-Dec-2010 MINOR CHANGES.

LS:
||~22-Oct-2010 CUSTOMER FILES MANAGER FUNCTIONALLITY HAS BEEN IMPROVED AND IT IS IN BETA PERIOD.

SCOPE:

- Now you will be able to attach zip files for specific products and customers through the 'Customer Files Manager' dialog located below the 'Utilities' menu.

This functionallity works with the hsbDataBank database, so you can manipulate the zip files and the references of them to the Customers easily.

The Type of zip files that you will have at the beginning are:

- TSL
- CUSTOM: They are dlls for customers basically
- CUSTOMER: They are specific zip files for customers with different kind of files. (Help files, Examples, Drawings, Documents, etc.)


The file references will be used by hsbUpdater to download the specific zip files for the customers that have been referenced.

The hsbUpdater will control the updating of this kind of zip files automatically. It will work similar as the Product zip files are managed. 

The hsbUpdater will decide where the zip files must go. 

The location where the zip files will be unzipped depend on the Zip File Type.

- The TSL zip files will be unzipped in the TSL folder included inside of the Company folder ("..\hsbCompany\TSL").

- The CUSTOM zip files location to unzip has not been defined yet.

- The CUSTOMER zip files will be able to be unzipped in the location where the customer decides.

In the future we will be able to add more Types if we need.

REMARKS:

- This is a time to test this new functionallity. You can familiarize with this new functionallity during this time. You should report me any remark that you have. TSL guys mainly should test this.

- The hsbUpdater changes to support this new functionallity are in development, so the current hsbUpdater release does not support this functionallity. This means that you must not distribute real files for the customers yet. Currently, the added files will not get by customers from hsbUpdater.

- When a new version of hsbUpdater supports this, a notification email will be send for the people who could be interested on use this new functionallity.

LS:
||~18-Oct-2010 AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION OPTION ALLOWS TO GENERATE A NEW LICENSE ACTIVATION PROCESS JUST AFTER YOU CHECK IT.

- Now you can generate new License Activation process just after you click the 'Automatic activation' check box without the requirement to Save the Changes first. 
Before this, you were required to Save the Changes before you generate a new License Activation process. 
Nevertheless, you must Save the Changes after you generate the new License Activation process in order to the license information be updated and other applications know about that.

LS:
||~15-Oct-2010 NEW FILTERS TO CUSTOMER NAME OR CUSTOMER PASSWORD WHEN LICENSE ACTIVATION EMAIL REPORTS ARE SENT

LS:
||~15-Jul-2010 FINGERPRINT EMAILS WILL INCLUDE THE ACTIVATION CODE TO ACTIVATE THE LICENSE IF THE LICENSE HAS AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION ENABLED IN THE NEXT CASES:

- When you generate new Licenses and send the fingerprints for the customers.

- When you generate Updater fingerprints and send the fingerprints for the customers.

This means that the generation of the activation code will be part of the procedure to generate these kind of fingerprints if the licenses have the Automatic Activation checked.

In these cases, you will not need to generate the activation code independently.

LS:
||~9-Jul-2010 VISIONREZ SYSTEM SECURITY FROM AMERICAD HAS BEEN INTEGRATED WITH FINGERPRINT SECURITY SYSTEM

- The Security System of VisionRez (Crypt Key Security) has been added to the DataBank structure. 

- It implies that the licenses are going to include new fields related with the VisionRez.

LS:
||~9-Jul-2010 SUPPORT TO AUTOMATIC ONLINE ACTIVATION OF HSB LICENSES HAS BEEN ADDED

- hsbProducts will be able to be activated online by Internet from the hsbSetup very soon. hsbDataBank gives the support to use it.

- In the Licenses Administrator, you will see one check box, and two new buttons related to that.

- If you want to allow that a customer activate his license online, you need to activate the option 'Automatic Activation' for the license, and you need to generate an activation code.

- An activation code is a random string of 20 characters that is associated to the license in the DataBank database. That code allows to Activate the license Online only one time for HSB licenses. For RDS licenses, it is a bit different.

- The activation code and other customer data must be entered in the hsbSetup by the Customer in order to the Activation Online works.

- The hsbSetup will allow the Automatic Activation only if there is Internet Connection in the Customer Machine. 

- The Online Activation will be launched at the end of the installation of a product from the hsbSetup. 

- The Customer could choose to activate or not. The default in hsbSetup is not to activate.

- The activation code is generated using the 'Gener. a New License Activ. to use during Setup, RDS Activ., or Change of hardware' button.

- The activation code allows to activate the License only one time. 

- If the customer wants to change his hardware or needs to reinstall the PC, you must decide if you generate a new activation code for him according to your controls to avoid the improper use of hsbCAD in other machines.

- The License Manager will return the same activation code until it is used.

LS:
||~9-Jul-2010 SUPPORT TO EXTENDING LICENSE ONLINE HAS BEEN ADDED

- In the Licenses Administrator, you will have the 'Automatic Activation' check box. If it is checked, it allows to extend and create a new fingerprint from the HSB_STARTUP dialog of ITWhsbCAD2011 and newer hsbCAD versions.

- It is so important that you check that option only for customers who have rights to activate hsbCAD.

- The data in the DataBank database that is related to the last fingerprint issued for the license will be used as the base to create the new fingerprint.

- The Activation Online and the Extending License Online will help to avoid the creation of the Request fingerprints and generation of complete fingerprints manually. Nevertheless, you must control what customers should use those methods.

- Please be careful using these methods.

LS:
||~9-Jul-2010 FINGERPRINT DATA HAS BEEN EXTENDED

The options to register online will be "Extend the license" and "Activate the License".

- There is a new button called "Generate Activat. Code to use during Setup or change of hardware".

This new button will generate an activation code automatically. This activation code will allow to Activate a License online if the license has the Automatic Activation flag enabled.

This activation code must be used the first time that the customer is going to install any product through this license or if the customer's hardware key has changed. It means that it will be used if the customer changes his hard disk.

This activation code will be unique for each license activation process. 

The activation code will be new for a license only if there is not any license activation process pending.

A license activation process will be considered as finished when the customer has registered its hsbProduct with this activation code.

The Licenses report dialogs and reports have been extended to include the new license properties in the queries.

The 'Last Version Allowed'has the format [Major Version],|[MinorVersion]|. Eg: 15,4
The Minor Version is optional, so the Last Version allowed could contain only the Major Version. Eg: 15

||~23-Ene-2006 DONGLES FINGER PRINTS:

- A new type of FingerPrint called Dongle Finger Print has been created. It works just like any other fingerprint, but it
uses the hardware information from the Dongle instead of from the computers hard drive. Whenever the user wants to enable
hsbCAD through a dongle, he must use a fingerprint that contains the dongles hardware. So if the dongle is moved from one
computer to the other, the fingerprint.bmp must follow (or be present). Each dongle should be attached to one, and only one
license in the hsbDataBank.

How to issue a dongle fingerprint:

You can create a dongle FingerPrint to a new license or to an existing license

- To the first time you should follow the following steps:
	- Connect the dongle USB to the computer you run hsbDataBank on.
	- Open the Licenses Administrator module

	- To an existing license, Select the license and click "Generate FingerPrint
	for dongle attached to this computer. 
	Dongle needs to be send together with fingerprint to the customer"


	- Follow the next steps and the Dongle FingerPrint will be created"
	(the AutoCadSN, ComputerName and ComputerUsername will have the value of "Floating")
 
- To the next times you will be able create a Dongle FP from a new USB dongle o from
	an existing dongle FP registered in the DataBase similar as if you create a Complete Finger
	Print

- The requests from a Dongle FP can be processed normally as the other requests

KR:
||~29-Dec-2005 IMPORTANT CHANGE: Fingerprint bitmaps changed.
A number of fingerprint bitmaps have been changed: LT, setup, update, request have now new reference bitmaps.
This allows easy identification of the type of bitmap. The activation bitmap has been left unchanged.
Of course customers that do not have an hsbCAD version newer then 12.0.44 will not be able to interprete the
new setup bitmap. So they should be given either an old bitmap or should download the new hsbCAD.
The activation bitmap will still work for older hsbCAD versions.
You can still generate the old bitmaps with the old hsbDataBank application if needed.

KR:
||~29-Dec-2005 A new type of request fingerprint to convert limited entities to full.
When hsbCAD is running in LT mode, beams and tools generated carry a "limited" flag.
These limited entities cannot be ouputted to CNC machines, or outputted to bill of material.
When a drawing is openend in a hsbCAD full version, that contains such limited entities,
the user can request a key to convert these limited entities into unlimited entities.
To convert these limited entities, a convert request fingerpint is send to hsb office.
The hsbDatabank application still needs to be modified such that it can generate
an unlock key for such a request.
